# Theoph-pharmacokinetic


This dataset contains information from a pharmacokinetic study involving 12 healthy volunteer subjects who were administered oral theophylline. Theophylline, a methylxanthine anti-asthma medication, functions as a bronchodilator and has secondary effects such as strengthening diaphragm contraction, reducing pulmonary artery pressures, and decreasing mast cell release. It can be administered intravenously, orally, or via rectal suppositories. Plasma levels of theophylline in the blood vary significantly among patients due to differences in drug clearance, influenced by factors such as body mass, age, smoking habits, liver and heart function, and viral infections. Furthermore, theophylline interacts with several common medications, which can alter its plasma concentration. In this study, each subject received a single oral dose of 300 mg of theophylline, converted to a milligrams per kilogram dose. Blood samples were collected frequently over the subsequent 25 hours, and the theophylline concentration in plasma was measured in micrograms per milliliter.
